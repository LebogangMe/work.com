            <h2>PROJECT 1 AUTO-TAXI SYSTEM</h2>
            <p> AutoTaxi-System
                In groups of 7 we were given an assignment to create any system we want,we came with

                AUTO TAXI is a taxi industry-based software system which provides help to taxi passengers to find a 
                taxi in a respective taxi rank to their destination. The software consists of registered routes which 
                taxis uses from one rank to another to their end destination, therefore on its duty of commuting 
                passengers, at first a user of the AUTO TAXI will gain access by logging in then navigate through the 
                system according to the taxi rank she/he is in and find all the information about the taxis operations, 
                and she will find all places that the taxis in that taxi rank transport passengers, and she/he will 
                choose where he/she is heading. Then passengers will indicate his/her spot of being dropped off 
                through the street’s names or any recognizable location through the AUTO TAXI software in line with 
                the route of a taxi.</p>






                <p>A taxi driver is one of the users too where he/she must through the system sign in his personal 
                credentials, even of the taxi he/she is driving, like registration number and color of the taxi. The taxi 
                driver will activate his/her turn on a line of commuting passengers with the spot in a taxi rank where 
                he/she is parked for passenger can easily identify the taxi. Therefore, after a passenger(s) find a taxi, 
                she/he will identify his/her drop off spot and the taxi driver will receive a message of passenger(s) 
                on where to be drop off on a registered route, of which there is a reminder to the taxi driver when 
                the taxi has reached the spot for a passenger to get off the taxi when it has arrived or reached the 
                spot identified of the passenger.</p>





               <p> It evens support paying taxi fare through the system; therefore, it identifies the passenger who paid 
                through the system to the taxi driver through the spot of being dropped of , as a measure of 
                assurance of valid payment made.
                The AUTO TAXI aims to optimes the way we deal with mobility and make travelling more 
                sustainable and efficient. AUTO TAXI provide solution on convenience public transport, smooth 
                electronic fare transactions, travel time improvement and reductions in delays at intersections. It 
                reduces even the case of being lost when looking for direction at times with misunderstanding when 
                asking people about taxis operations. One of the main benefits is enhancing the safety and quality of 
                life for everyone in urban, even rural areas. Overall, intelligent mobility’s main benefits include 
                better safety, accessibility, and sustainability of transportation systems</p>
